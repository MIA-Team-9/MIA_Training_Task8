**Author:** Amir Kasseb

## Description

This program is designed to detect and highlight blue and red balls in an input image. It then draws rectangles around the detected balls and labels them as "Blue Ball" or "Red Ball." The output image is saved in a folder named "output" with the same name as the input file.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need the following:

- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- An input image containing blue and red balls (place the image in the 'images' folder)

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install the required Python packages if you haven't already:

pip install opencv-python numpy

python
Copy code

3. Create a folder named 'images' in the same directory as the script.

## Usage

1. Place your input image in the 'images' folder.

2. Update the `img = cv.imread('images/rb_021.jpg')` line with the correct filename of your input image.

3. Run the program.
